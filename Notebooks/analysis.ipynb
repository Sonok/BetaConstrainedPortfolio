    "# Beta-Constrained Long-Short Portfolio Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to construct a beta-constrained, market-neutral long-short portfolio using a diversified set of assets. We will employ a structured approach to achieve a balanced risk-return profile while maintaining minimal exposure to overall market movements (beta neutrality). The analysis period covers data from January 1, 2022, through the most recent available date.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we outline the project’s objectives, key requirements, and high-level strategy for constructing a beta-constrained, market-neutral portfolio. We will balance long and short positions using quantitative optimization techniques to achieve minimal market exposure while enhancing returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Collection and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Yahoo Finance to download historical daily price data for both the long and short tickers. The data will be processed and organized into a structured format suitable for portfolio analysis and backtesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Through exploratory data analysis, we aim to understand the characteristics of our asset pool. We will examine the distribution of sectors, historical price trends, and calculate daily returns. This analysis will guide our decisions in the optimization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Portfolio Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The portfolio optimization step will involve setting up a beta-constrained model. We will calculate each asset’s beta relative to a benchmark, define an objective function, and set constraints to achieve market neutrality. The output will be a set of optimized weights for long and short positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backtesting the Portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will simulate portfolio performance over the historical data period. The backtesting process will incorporate a 3% trailing stop-loss rule to manage risk, and we will evaluate the portfolio’s cumulative return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and adherence to the beta constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results and Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "We will review the optimized portfolio’s performance, discussing the impact of the beta constraint, risk-return profile, and stop-loss rule. Insights from these results will inform our evaluation of the strategy’s effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The conclusion will provide final reflections on the beta-constrained long-short strategy and suggestions for potential future improvements.\n",

    "# Portfolio Overview: Long and Short Tickers\n",
    "\n",
    "This portfolio consists of a mix of long and short positions across various sectors, providing a diversified approach aimed at achieving a beta-constrained, market-neutral strategy. Here’s a breakdown of the long and short tickers by industry sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Long Tickers (Positions You’ll Hold Long)\n",
    "These long positions are a mix of well-established companies across various sectors, reflecting stability and growth potential:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industrials\n",
    "- **Examples**: Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), Honeywell (HON), Parker Hannifin (PH), Stanley Black & Decker (SWK), United Rentals (URI)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Consumer Discretionary\n",
    "- **Examples**: Home Depot (HD), Lowe’s (LOW), O’Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY), Royal Caribbean (RCL)\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: Discretionary goods and services that consumers buy with disposable income. Perform well in a strong economy but may be more volatile in downturns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Utilities\n",
    "- **Examples**: Exelon (EXC), ONEOK (OKE), NiSource (NI)\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: Essential services like electricity and natural gas. Often seen as defensive stocks, providing stability and dividends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Materials\n",
    "- **Examples**: Dow Inc. (DOW), LyondellBasell (LYB), Sherwin-Williams (SHW), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM)\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: Chemicals, construction materials, and industrial goods. Sensitive to global economic conditions and commodity prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Energy\n",
    "- **Examples**: Baker Hughes (BKR), Targa Resources (TRGP)\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: Oil and gas infrastructure and services. Highly cyclical, influenced by oil prices and global energy demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Financials\n",
    "- **Examples**: Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Paychex (PAYX)\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: Payroll and HR services, indirectly tied to employment trends and business activity levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Estate and Telecom\n",
    "- **Examples**: American Tower (AMT), T-Mobile (TMUS)\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: Telecom and infrastructure. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are often used for income through dividends.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Short Tickers (Positions You’ll Short)\n",
    "These short positions generally include companies that may be more volatile or cyclical, which can add balance to a beta-constrained, market-neutral strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technology\n",
    "- **Examples**: Etsy (ETSY), Illumina (ILMN), Paycom Software (PAYC), EPAM Systems (EPAM)\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: Growth-focused companies. Shorting tech stocks can help offset volatility and potential downturns, especially in high-valuation environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Healthcare\n",
    "- **Examples**: Dexcom (DXCM), Moderna (MRNA)\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: High-risk areas, like biotech, may face regulatory or scientific setbacks, which can make shorting beneficial for risk management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consumer Discretionary\n",
    "- **Examples**: VF Corporation (VFC), Airbnb (ABNB), Expedia Group (EXPE), Charter Communications (CHTR)\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: Non-essential spending, which can decline in economic downturns as consumers cut back on discretionary expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Energy\n",
    "- **Examples**: APA Corporation (APA), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Valero Energy (VLO), Halliburton (HAL), Marathon Oil (MRO)\n",

    "### Materials\n",
    "- **Examples**: Mosaic Company (MOS)\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: Agricultural products, sensitive to commodity prices and agricultural demand cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Estate\n",
    "- **Examples**: CoreSite Realty (COR), Boston Properties (BXP)\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: REITs with exposure to commercial and data center properties. Shorting real estate stocks can hedge against economic cycles affecting property values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industrials\n",
    "- **Examples**: United Parcel Service (UPS)\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: Transportation and logistics. Demand for shipping can decline during economic downturns, balancing cyclical risk through short positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Portfolio Diversification\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Long Positions**: The long positions cover a wide range of sectors, including defensive sectors like healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples, which provide stability. Technology and consumer discretionary names add growth potential, while industrials and materials offer broader economic exposure.\n",
    "- **Short Positions**: Short positions are concentrated in technology, energy, and consumer discretionary sectors, which are often more cyclical or volatile. This selection provides balance to the portfolio by offsetting potentially high-growth but high-risk sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Beta Constraint**: By balancing long positions in relatively stable sectors with short positions in cyclical or high-growth areas, we aim to achieve a beta-constrained, market-neutral portfolio.\n",
    "- **Risk-Return Profile**: The long positions in essential sectors and shorts in cyclical areas create a balanced risk-return profile, protecting the portfolio in both bullish and bearish market environments.\n"
